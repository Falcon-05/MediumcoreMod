# MediumcoreMod
This mod makes Classic & Journey players start with a consumable item that permanently activates a "Soft Mediumcore" mode upon use.
They additionally spawn with an item that tells you whether the mode is on or not (useful for returning to a character after a long break).

In this mode, you will drop all of your coins and items in your inventory on death, regardless of world difficulty. You will NOT drop anything in your hotbar, equipment slots, or ammo slots.
A Copper Shortsword, Copper Pickaxe, and Copper Axe will still spawn in your inventory, just to be safe.
Have fun not getting softlocked because you died deep underground in Hardmode!

If you accidentally activate the mode, you can cheat in a usually-unobtainable item that reverts you back to normal softcore.

# Known Issues:
* When Soft Mediumcore mode is enabled, the death screen doesn't display how much money you dropped
